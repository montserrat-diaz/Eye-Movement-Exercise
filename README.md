# Eye-Movement-Exercise
My task in this exercise was to animate a pair of eyes so that the pupil would follow the mouse position on the screen.

Open the index.html file on a browser to see the eyes follow your mouse position.

Roadmap of future improvements: I would like to eventually add more design and detail to the eyes. Maybe even make them blink occasionally.
